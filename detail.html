                                        “I thought a lot about what I should do, and then decided to join an armed group, because I knew we would have to use weapons to fight an armed force.”

                                        More accustomed to holding chalk than guns, she faced many difficulties in turning herself into a soldier. She had to transform herself physically and mentally during the military training.

                                        “I was away from my family. I couldn’t support or take care of them the way I did before. It wasn’t easy being a woman in military training,” she said.

                                        “But I am prepared to face any obstacle to overthrow the military dictatorship,” she added.

                                        The Yaw PDF was formed five months after the coup. From the beginning, it has included CDM doctors and teachers who received military training from ethnic armed groups.

                                        Its goal is to uproot the military dictatorship and replace it with a new federal democracy that guarantees equality among all ethnic groups. It seeks to achieve autonomy and peace in a country that has long deprived its people of both.

                                        Unlike many other PDFs, the Yaw PDF is part of a nascent federal army being formed by Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government (NUG). It reports directly to the NUG’s Ministry of Defence and is under its command structure.

                                        It is also one of several resistance forces active in the area. It has cooperated with a number of these other groups to carry out 30 missions, including ambushes and landmine attacks.
